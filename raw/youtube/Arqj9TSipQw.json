  "full_text": "All right, quick video today. As you know, we were just at CES seeing all the new laptops for 2026. Now, one of the announcements that caught our eye was, of course, the new ThinkPads. This isn't a sponsored video. I just thought you might be interested to see what's going on. So, today I've got two very cool updates for you and then just some really silly nonsense. So, I'm going to start with the ThinkPad X915. That laptop won our award last year as the best premium Windows 1. It's a thin and light laptop that has an excellent webcam, phenomenal battery life, and a stunning large 15.3 in OLED display. Well, this year it's being updated with Intel's new Panther 8 chips, aka the Cortra series 3. There will be an option for the high performing ones with the powerful 12core XC3 integrated GPU. What's super cool about this is Lenovo are actually feeding at the max of 45 W sustained power. This is just great. I always felt nervous, you see, recommending that laptop to people like programmers who probably should get something more powerful than the Luna Lake CPU, which it used to come with. In fact, hang tight on that. Not all the generations of these new X915s have the new CPU. Anyway, in addition to this, the new X915 does have a slightly larger battery at 88W hours, up from 83. It's a small change, but again, still good to see. It also has two additional ports this year. You get a third USBC Thunderbolt port on the left side and an SD card reader on the right. Again, obviously good, but there is a catch. The Lenovo product manager told us it's only a slower UHS1 SD card reader, not UHS2. Perhaps he got it wrong, as it kind of makes no sense to have a slower one in such a premium laptop. But what truly makes no sense is the naming of this product. It's going to be called the ThinkPad X915P Gen1, where P apparently stands for performance. Guys, no consumer is going to know this. And I know these are often bought by corporates, but even the corporate buying person may not know this. And secondly, why is it called Gen 1? This is obviously a Gen 2 device. Every Lenovo laptop goes up a generation each year when a new CPU is included. This makes absolutely no sense and is going to be a real risk for buyers. I can actually see people accidentally buying the older one because they just don't know the difference and think these are the same laptops. Now, for an alternate take, Seth doesn't mind the new name. He feels the P indicates a different laptop like the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. I personally disagree. I think there was the ThinkPad say T14 and T14S where S was the slimmer one and the T14 was the thicker one with upgradeable memory. But even then, the generations were kept the same. So, if they both have Panther Lake, it's the same generation on the name. Here, it's different. So, overall, good update to a laptop we really like, but with a stupid name. Next, we have an update to Lenovo's signature ThinkPad X1 Carbon and its twoin-1 version. Both of their chassis have been redesigned this year, and they use a two-sided motherboard. According to Lenovo, this should actually help with repairability. Apparently, it's USB ports, battery, keyboard, speakers, and the fans. They're all easier to access. Now, this new internal design also supposedly makes room for better cooling. Both the X1 Carbon and the 2-in-1 variant, they now come with up to Intel's newest X7 processors running at 30 W sustained power. This makes sense as we of course are looking at a smaller chassis here than the larger ThinkPad X915 that I just talked about. These laptops will also both come with a larger haptic touchpad and an improved 10 megapixel webcam with a wide field of view. When we saw the laptop in person, we felt the design looked really nice, and it just still feels incredibly wellbuilt and rigid. All right, time for one of the silliest things we saw, the ThinkBook Plus Auto Twist. This is exactly what it sounds like, a laptop with a motorized hinge that can twist automatically. Basically, if you're on a video call, it can just follow you around. Sounds cool in theory. In practice, it was a disaster. Just take a look at our B-roll, guys. It really struggled when there was more than one person in frame. it just didn't know who to focus on. Realistically, this thing is just going to be dizzying for the person on the other end of your conference call. And I'm going to call a spade a spade here. It isn't that hard to just turn your laptop around to begin with. To me, this just screams of potential issues like another part that could break. Lastly was another concept product, a rollable screen laptop like the one they released last year, but this time the extra screen real estate actually wraps around the back of the laptop. So you can have these widgets and notifications on the back of your laptop's lid. Look, this one also felt a bit silly. I mean, who looks at the back of their screen? But it did have this kind of more intuitive way of raising the screen. You just swipe along the top versus pressing a button on the keyboard deck like last year's. I think realistically this is going to be a tough sell given how mature Asus's redesigned ZenBook Duo is and Lenovo they don't have a launch date for this product anyway. Well, let me know with a comment below what you think of these new ThinkPads. Guys, am I being too tough here? If you are in the market to buy a laptop right now, you know what I'm going to say. Make sure to check out our website, bestlaptop.deals. Over there, we are demystifying laptop shopping. clear recommendations for each type of buyer. And we even track prices right across retailers so you know you're getting the best deal. Thanks for watching. Until next time, go do something awesome with your day and I will catch you later.",
