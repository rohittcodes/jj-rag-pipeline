This one also frequently comes in around $1200 or less which makes it one of the more affordable laptops packing this type of power in such a lightweight, portable package. Our biggest con on this one is that it is not always offered with 32GB of memory in the U.S., which is what we "

That's because it performs very well and stays very cool, a rare combination in a high powered laptop. It also has nice creature comforts like an attractive Mini-LED screen, good selection of ports, and a comfortable keyboard without a numpad. What's not to like?"

Its keyboard deck can be placed on top of the bottom screen where it charges. It also performs very well with an Arrow Lake H processor. The main con of the duo is that its design does lead to a thicker and heavier laptop than the average 14-inch, but you are getting twice the screen real estate so we feel it's a fair tradeoff."
